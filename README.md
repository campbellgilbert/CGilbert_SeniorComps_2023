# RavenDesk

A word processor made for creative writers, by a creative writer, with a built-in AI "peer editor". My completed senior comps project. Official app download TBD; if you want to use it, open in Visual Studio or VSCode with a .NET MAUI extension.

IMPORTANT NOTE: if you do not insert your own API key in the FeedbackPage.cs file, the code will not run. Since this is a simple full-stack app there's no way to use my own key without exposing it.
